# Flights2Twine

This site will take a CSV backup file from <a href="https://openflights.org/">OpenFlights.org</a> and turn it into a <a href="http://twinery.org/">Twine</a> story.

It gives you a Twine story that keeps count of the number of flights you've taken and the distance traveled.  From here you can start adding your own narrative about the travels that this involves.

There is an example story which uses Alice's flight data.

Here is what you should be aware of:

* The IFID should be changed if you plan on publishing your story
* If there are no flights out of an airport your readers will get stuck there (unless they use the back button)

There are a number of things which we would like to improve:

* Clean up the output and add country flags
